# RedSoloGame
Produced a complex card game in Java featuring Model-View-Controller architecture, handling game state management,
rule enforcement, and configurable gameplay modes (Basic/Advanced).
Built a rule engine handling five distinct victory conditions based on card properties (color proximity, number sequences,
palette combinations), supporting dynamic game state evaluation and real-time win condition checking.
